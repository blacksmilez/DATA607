### Objective \
Understand the value of collaboration to strengthen team members' soft skills. Expand knowledge of data collecting, tidying, transformations, and exploratory data analysis in R. \


### Group Members 
1. Daria Dubovskaia
2. Wilson Chau
3. Seung Min Song
4. Ted Kim


### Collaboration Tools \
We have chosen the most common collaboration tools to work on the project. \
For the communication, the team will use a messaging program, **Slack**, <https://slack.com/>. \
Project management will be organized via platform for software development and version control, **GitHub**, <https://github.com/blacksmilez/DATA607/tree/main/Project3>. Project progress will be managed by **GitHub Board**, <https://github.com/users/blacksmilez/projects/2/views/1>.\
As well as a code sharing will also be organized via **GitHub** since team members can change the code and commit changes to the general file. \
Since the assignment is including the work with databases, we have decided to use **Microsoft Azure Database** for MySQL Database, <https://azure.microsoft.com>. As a result, all teammates will be able to work together on the same database in real time and access the latest version of our database. \
Project documentation and coding will be done by each team member via an integrated development environment for R, **RStudio**\
**Rpubs** will be used for easy web publishing from R to present the work to the Professor, <https://rpubs.com/seungm1nsong/956997>. \
The team chose Slack and GitHub as the main collaboration tools because all four members are comfortable using those two tools. Using unfamiliar tools will reduce efficiency and slow the project progress. Moreover, each member has a different background and the project period is relatively short. Therefore, we chose to use familiar tools, GitHub and Slack.\

### Data Source\ 
**DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results.** \
(DOHMH_New_York_City_Restaurant_Inspection_Results.csv 102MB) \
The data will be downloaded as CSV file and loaded in R using read.csv() function. The source of the dataset: <https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j> \
The dataset contains 239,000 observations of 27 variables. \
The dataset contains every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an active status on the RECORD DATE (date of the data pull). When an inspection results in more than one violation, values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation record. Establishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record ID) number. Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset. \
Records are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the ACTION field. \
Because this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be missing. \
This dataset and the information on the Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source. The Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website is available via the link below:
<http://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page> \
The description of the columns is provided at the link below:
<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j>


### Entity-Relationship diagram \
A physical data model for the normalized database, and an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is available via team's GitHub repository. On our ER diagram we have a few approaches to doing some analytical deliverable where we can inspect our dataset. One option is going through inspection type with and without the influence of inspection_code. This can give us some correlation where inspection code may have different types of inspection results. Another investigation road we can focus on would be the building and how it can influences some of the inspection results. These types of focuses can give us some insights on how New York Restaurant inspections are being graded and the types of influences that will affect the grading of the inspections for these NYC restaurants.\
